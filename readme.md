# My Nix Config

Currently only darwin (MacOS) works. 
Linux support is planned, but I don't need this right now.

I made the switch from `brew`, because I cannot stand all the weird globally installed things.

Currently Racket is installed globally, as there are errors with it not finding some dynamic library on MacOS.
I am gonna install this later.
